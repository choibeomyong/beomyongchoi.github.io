connect to mysql

`$ mysql -uroot -p`

and here are the commands you want

{% highlight bash %}
# create a user command
create user 'yourusername'@'yourport' identified by 'yourpassword';

# grant all permission to this user
grant all privileges on *.* to 'yourusername'@'yourport';

# grant specific database's permission to this user
grant all privileges on databasename.* to 'yourusername'@'yourport';
{% endhighlight %}
